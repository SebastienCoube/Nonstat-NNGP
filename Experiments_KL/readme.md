These are the scripts needed to reproduce the empirical Kullback-Leibler results presented in the paper. 
You will need to get yourself a SLURM cluster to run them. 
In each of the folders, you will find a Run.sh and an Experiment_script.R. 
Use the former to launch the later. Then you should get a res_<elliptic/circular>.RDS. 
Use Analysis.R to reproduce the linear models presented in the paper.
