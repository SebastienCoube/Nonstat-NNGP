# Bidart-Nonstat-NNGP

This repository contains the implementation of nonstationary NNGPs from Coube-Sisqueille, Banerjee, and Liquet. It features : 

* The source code of the package **Bidart** for nonstationary NNGPs
* Various vignettes in the dedicated folder **Vignettes** : 
  - vignette_tour_objects_functions explains how the package works and details the elements of the objects and the arguments of the functions
  - vignette_heteroscedasticity shows how to work with heteroscedastic variance for the latent field and the noise
  - vignette_range_locally_isotropic shows how to work with locally isotropic range parameters
  - vignette_range_locally_anisotropic shows how to work with locally anisotropic range parameters
* A script to analyze lead contamination and the required data in the folder **Heavy_metals**
* The experiments on synthetic data sets presented in the paper, with some instructions to run them, in the folders **Experiments_KL** and **Experiments_wrong_modelling**.
