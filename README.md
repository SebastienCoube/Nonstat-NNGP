# Bidart-Nonstat-NNGP

This repository contains the implementation of nonstationary NNGPs from Sébastien Coube-Sisqueille, Sudipto Banerjee, and Benoît Liquet. It features : 

* A **VIGNETTE** which you must **download** and **open from your laptop** because it is too big for Github's preview. To do this, **right-click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastienCoube/Nonstat-NNGP/master/vignette_.html)** and select **save link as...** . 
* The source code of the package **Bidart** for nonstationary NNGPs.
* The compressed package for installation. You can download it from **[there](https://github.com/SebastienCoube/Nonstat-NNGP/blob/master/Bidart_1.1.tar.gz)**.
* Scripts to analyze a lead contamination data set and the required data in the folder **Heavy_metals**.
* The experiments on synthetic data sets presented in the paper, with some instructions to run them, in the folders **Experiments_KL** (Kullback-Leibler between NNGP and full GP), **Experiments_wrong_modelling** (improvements brought by nonstationary models), and **UCLA** (comparison between NNGP and other nonstationary GP methods).
* Scripts to analyze a NDVI data set and the required data in the folder **NDVI_r2**.
